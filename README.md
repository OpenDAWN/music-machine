Interactively generate music by defining a musical style in terms of [interval numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)#Number) in a [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar).

## Overview

This module is an extension of [grammar-graph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grammar-graph) built specifically to construct music from patterns of [interval numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)#Number) which can then be applied to any [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)) or [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)#Modern).

An example definition in a grammar might be:
```
Intone: 3 3 -2

```
This means to move up a third, then up a third again, and then down a second.

```
Intone in C minor:
  +3    +3   -2
C    Eb    G    F

Intone in D major:
  +3    +3   -2
D    F#    A    G
```

Good music is often made up of just a few small patterns which are combined to make something bigger. For example, repeating `Intone` three times makes a nice sequence, so we might define `IntoneSequence` in terms of the already defined `Intone`:
```
IntoneSequence: Intone Intone Intone

IntoneSequence in G major:
 +3  +3  -2   +3   +3   -2    +3   +3   -2
G   B   D   C    E    G    F#    A    C    B
```

Music-machine solves the more complicated problem of applying patterns to any key. If you instead want to define a musical grammar in terms of literal notes like this:
```
JupiterTheme: C D F E
```
You should use [grammar-graph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grammar-graph) directly instead of this library.


## Goals

1. Input a context-free grammar to represent intervals in music
  - the grammar consists of simple intervals in relation to a scale
  - negative numbers indicate a descending interval

2. Allow additional filters for contextual restrictions. Filters can be permanent or expire after a certain point (ie, expire after a direction change)
  - max range
  - allowed interval qualities
  - limit repetitions/sequences

3. Internally, the program translates filtered intervals into actual notes in the provided scale and returns these notes as choices.
